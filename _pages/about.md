I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computational and Data Sciences at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/), and my research field is  **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Before this, I received my Master of Science degree in Computer Science from [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/), and received my Master of Science degree from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/). I also completed my undergraduate at [BNU–HKBU United International College](https://uic.edu.cn/) and earned my Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Computer Science and Technology from [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/).

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

<!-- 我的研究兴趣包括人工智能（AI）的算法，理论和应用。我专注于研发AI新算法，提升AI模型的各项性能，我也专注于如何在不同的领域更好地应用AI模型。同时，我也对物理学很感兴趣。以下是我目前的研究兴趣： -->
My research interests include algorithms, theories, and applications of **artificial intelligence (AI)**. I focus on developing new AI algorithms and improving the performance of AI models. I also focus on how to better apply AI models in different fields. At the same time, I am also very interested in physics. The following are my current research interests:
